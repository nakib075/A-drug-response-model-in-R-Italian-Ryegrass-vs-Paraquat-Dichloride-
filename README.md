Investigation of the mechanism of Paraquat resistance in Italian ryegrass populations

Research Objective

The objective of this research was to investigate the mechanism of paraquat resistance in Italian ryegrass resistant populations collected in Louisiana sugarcane fields. 


A drug dose-response model was developed to measure the efficacy of a herbicide dose for control of the Italian ryegrass.
